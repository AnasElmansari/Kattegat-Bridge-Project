# Kattegat-Bridge-Project
A program, developed using C programming and four different datasets, calculates the optimal route and CO2 emissions for the current trains, the future IC5 trains, and the IC5 trains operating on the proposed Kattegat Bridge project. At the heart of this program is Dijkstra's algorithm, which is used to determine the shortest and most efficient routes between train stations. The algorithm processes a weighted graph where nodes represent stations and edges represent tracks with associated costs, such as distance or estimated emissions. By integrating the results from Dijkstra's algorithm with detailed emission calculations, the program not only highlights the efficiency of rail transport but also underscores the unnecessary reliance on domestic flights in Denmark and the harmful CO2 emissions they produce. This approach emphasizes the environmental benefits of investing in sustainable rail projects over short-haul flights.
