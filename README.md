# Kattegat-Bridge-Project
A program, developed using C programming and four different datasets, calculates the optimal route and CO2 emissions for the current trains, the future IC5 trains, and the IC5 trains operating on the proposed Kattegat Bridge project. The program fundamentally supports the argument against the necessity of domestic flights in Denmark and highlights the harmful CO2 emissions they generate.
